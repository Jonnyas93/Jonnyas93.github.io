Tankazooka is a side-scrolling platformer where you command a broken tank, with no tracks you must use your cannon to launch yourself across lush farmlands and desolated cityscapes to rejoin your convoy. 

I worked on this game as a software engineer and designer, creating the initial prototype of the game (Which you can try <a href="">here</a>).

In the course of working on this project I utilized my skills in
<ul>
  <li>C# Scripting</li>
  <li>Unity Engine</li>
  <li>Source control (Git/Github)</li>
  <li>Project management</li>
</ul>

Unity provided an interesting work environment as a software engineer, requiring the ability to work with a sometimes inflexible system to achieve the result that was desired out of the project. 
Additionally working in a video game development environment has made me more conscious of resource requirements of a piece of software, as realtime high framerate application performance is critical to the products success. 
The video game development process is also one of variability and change, so I have become accustomed to workload shifting dramatically, dealing with non-standard problems, and handling complicated edge cases (e.g. cases that arise from more than standard UI interactions)
Ultimately developing this taught me a lot about the process of developing software in the technical sense, but also about the User Experience, and how to work with a multi-discipline team.

The team:
<ul>
  <li>Holly Quihampton: Producer</li>
  <li>Trent Euman: Game Designer</li>
  <li>Audrey (Jay) Juventia: Artist</li>
  <li>Raymond Lim: Game Designer/Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Ramon Bellett: Animator</li>
  <li>Cody Cronin-Sporys: Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Jared Capadouca: Engineer</li>
  <li>Jordan Moore: Composer</li>
  <li>Godwin Lai: Composer</li>
</ul>
